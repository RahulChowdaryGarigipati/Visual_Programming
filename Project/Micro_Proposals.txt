1.) Drum Machine: Build a Drum Machine using max or pd by creating a variety of drum sounds using patches(objects) to generate a wide range of sounds. Add controls for adjusting the Bass, tempo, and effects of the drum. Yes, I think we can build a prototype and the idea seems to be intresting as we can create something intresting using visual programming, and hence I dont think the idea is too vague, building a prototype and testing it to generate diffrent drum sounds can be done.

2.) Guitar Music Genertor: Build a Guitar Music Genertor using max or pd by creating patches(objects) to generate realistic or stylized guitar sounds and then add the controls to arrange the sounds into different patterns, melodies, and chords. Yes, I think we can build a prototype and the idea seems to be intresting as we can create something intresting using visual programming, and hence I dont think the idea is too vague, building a prototype and testing it to generate differnet patterns of the guitar sounds can be done.

3.) Electronic Harp: Build an Electronic Harp using max or pd by creating different patches to generate different real-life harp sounds. The idea seems too vague and hence I dont think I will be able to create a prototype for this. But it seems intresting to try how I can make or atleast try to make real life harp sounds in visual programming using different techniques.
